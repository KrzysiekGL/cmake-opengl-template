# CMake OpenGL template
This repository serves as a learning ground for creating buildsystem with CMake
as well as using CMake with OpenGL.

For now it's quite basic and may be considered faulty. The template will be in development
and progress along with my understanding of CMake.

Since the repository contains
[***submodules***](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules),
clone it with `--recurse-submodules`.
