# CMake OpenGL template
This repository serves as a learning ground for creating buildsystem with CMake
as well as using CMake with OpenGL.

For now it's quite basic and may be considered faulty.
The template is in development and progress should follow
long with my understanding of CMake and building C/C++ projects in general.

Since the repository contains
[*submodules*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules),
clone it with `--recurse-submodules`.
